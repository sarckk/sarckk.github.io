Inspired by the advice of [identifying things that are bothering you and you are willing to fix](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9436455-pay-attention-focus-on-your-surroundings-physical-and-psychological-notice#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20such%20somethings,the%20questions%2C%20then%20look%20elsewhere.), several posts on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) I read today, and my own frustrations about not getting some shit done recently, I'm compiling a list of things I'd like to improve in my life this year, categorized along several different but related dimensions. I'm sharing these publicly to keep myself accountable for them.

p.s. if I know you in real life, feel free to share your own goals with me. I think it's incredibly helpful to have someone to be accountable to in one's self-improvement journey.

- **Social**
  - I want to be more proactive in meeting new people. I've come to accept that it's going to [take effort](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-23-taking-social-initiative) [to find my "tribe"](https://thesephist.com/posts/find-your-people/). 
    - **Plan**: I've tried going for random meetups but they weren't great. So now I want to go for meetups that are oriented around some activity, like hiking or sports, because I can at least enjoy the activity even if I don't necessarily click with the people I meet. 
    - I also think going deeper into my interests, like AI, or cultivating new interests (like playing tennis) could be promising avenues to meet similar-minded people. For example, [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) started out as a bunch of strangers online interested in doing open-source AI research work.

- **Hobbies & Fun** 
    - I'd like to add more dimensions to my life than just tech:
        - I'd like to play the guitar well. I'm particularly interested in electric guitar and gypsy jazz.
            - **Plan**: Realistically I know I won't be putting in time to practice daily, but I think I can commit to 1 hour a week during the weekends. The last time I lost interest because I was focused on mastering picking and chords without putting it to use -- this time, I'm going to make it fun for me by learning just enough chords to play songs I like and working from there.
        - I want to learn tennis.
            -  **Plan**: I know there is a tennis coaching programme at a park near my place, so sign up for next available season if the price is right? I can reimburse the cost through my employer's health allowance.
    - Sometimes I can be a pretty harsh critic to myself. And while I feel like I owe some of my achievements to this trait, I'd like to let myself enjoy life a little more.
      - **Plan**: Do more things that make me happy, like chilling at my favorite spot in London on a sunny Sunday afternoon ðŸ˜Š

- **Character**
    - I want to be **someone who does things** -- someone who is inclined towards action. Many times in the past I've felt motivated to do something, and either never got past the "planning" stage or never followed it up with consistent effort. The many projects I've never shipped, and the Yamaha Pacifica collecting dust in my living room are reminders of this.
      - **Problem**: Lack of momentum creates resistance, and projects are often too ambitious in scope. Need to shorten time to receive positive feedback -- for example, video games are fun because of the tight feedback loop.
      - **Plan**: Ship simple, unpolished projects to build up momentum, starting with a one weekend project, then a week-long one, and a month-long project.

- **Work & Career**
  - I want to invest more time after work to explore my interests and develop skills.
    - **Plan**: For various reasons I'm unable to suddently ramp down the time spent at work. The more actionable plan is to accept that I'll need to work hard until I complete some of the major problems to be solved at work, and to set a date after which I will need to be more strict about how I manage my time and energy.

- **Finances** 
  - I'd like to get my finances in order and reach Â£50k in assets.
    - **Plans**:
        - Move to a place with cheaper rent after my contract expires.
        - Start cooking more regularly once I move out. 
        - Continue saving and invest in index funds.

- **Spirituality** 
  - I want to manage stress and anxiety better. I'm aware that most of the time, these emotions have no objective basis in reality and are induced by the mind, by projecting itself either to the past or to the future. 
    - **Plan**: Sign up for Headspace free trial and start meditating again. For now, I think I can commit to 10 minutes of meditaition in the morning each day, before work.

- **Health**
  - I'd like to maintain a more consistent sleep and exercise schedule.
    - **Plan**: Get to sleep by 12pm and wake up at 8am. Get at least 30 minutes of gym before work, 3 times a week.
  - Eat more healthily.
    - **Plan**: Skip on fried stuff, sugary drinks and dessert at the office.
  - Follow through on the healthcheck appointments that I've been putting off for a while.


There are more things I wanted to write but I'd be risking having too many things on my plate and not following through on any of them. For now, I think these are more than enough to keep me busy for the rest of the year.

That said, I'm personally also wary of the risk of trying to hyper-optimize my life around these goals. As important as taking steps to improve oneself is, I think it's equally important to approach life with a sort of playful lightheartedness. 

### Tsuyoku Naritai!
In Japanese, "Tsuyoku Naritai" means "I want to become stronger". I first came across this phrase in [a post on LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoLQN5ryZ9XkZjq5h/tsuyoku-naritai-i-want-to-become-stronger) and it has since stuck with me. It's the kind of attitude I'd like to take in life: I want to be stronger, more resilient, more knowledgeable, meet more interesting people, and generally live a meaningful and fulfilling life. And while I feel like there's many things that I need to "sort out" on my path towards such a life, the upside is that there are many low-hanging fruits that I can pick to improve my situation *right now*, which is pretty awesome.
