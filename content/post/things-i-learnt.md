It's recently been 6 months since I started my first full-time job as a software engineer after graduating from university last year. A lot has changed in my life, and I thought I'd write about the things I've learned about myself, career, and life in the past half a year. I don't claim most of these to be original thoughts: many are an amalgamation of things I've read/heard about but have only recently begun to fully appreciate. It's also a list of things that I believe to be generally true at the time of me writing this, but I suspect some of these will not apply to all situations or people (see learning #8) or will need to be updated with more nuance in the future. Notwithstanding, I think these are generally good statements to live by. I myself try to incorporate these learnings into my life, but as with most things, it's a process! That said, I found the practice of compiling the list of things I've learned to be incredibly helpful in clarifying my own beliefs and putting my experience into perspective and recommend that others try it out too. With that, here's some things I've learned recently:

1. The process of *becoming* something gives your life a whole lot of meaning. Much of life is becoming a better version of yourself.
2. Everything is transcient. 
3. The best people learn to work with the constraints they have and turn them into an advantage.
4. Sometimes you really do need to eat a shit sandwich. Resigning yourself to this makes eating it easier.
5. One antidote to emptiness/meaninglessness -- other than spirituality -- that I suspect would work for a lot of people is to explore something to the fullest until you get to the bottom of *how* it works and *why* it works that way.
6. If you don't know what you want to do right now, a good place to start is to try to improve the little things that are bothering you.
7. Your intention determines what you see. 
8. Few things are completely black or white; most truths lie somewhere in the nuanced shades of gray. You should generally be wary of any worldview that presents a binary picture of the world.
9. Doing something, even if it doesn't immediately appeal to you, is better than doing nothing. If at the end of it you realize you don't like doing it, that's a valuable lesson learned. 
10. It's important to [take a long-term view of things](https://norvig.com/21-days.html). Life is pretty long.
11. Life is also pretty short. Prioritize ruthlessly.
12. The only reliable way to figure out what you like is by trying out a lot of things. 
13. If life feels like [eating one frog after another](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/excuse-me-but-why-are-you-eating), you're probably doing something wrong.
14. Saying "no" can be important, but when you're young, it's often a good strategy to lean towards a "yes" *if you're unsure*. This is because most people are in the [divergent](https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/) phases of their lives when they're young.
15. Exercise!
16. The amount of human ingenuity that went into the things around you -- including the device you're reading this post on -- is really quite staggering.
17. Sometimes you need to fall into mud to really know how to get out of it, so don't beat yourself up for having fallen into one.
18. Most things in life aren't *that* important and only a few are.
