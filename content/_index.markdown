Sometimes I have an urge to write things: maybe it's [something I learned recently](https://sarckk.github.io/post/2023/02/12/things-i-learned-recently/) or maybe it's just an interesting idea I've mulling over for a while. I'm currently interested in and learning about large language models and how/why they work, hoping to understand how emergent properties arise from scaling these networks.
