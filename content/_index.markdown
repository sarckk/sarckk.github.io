Sometimes I have an urge to write things: maybe it's something I learnt recently or maybe it's just an interesting idea I've mulling over for a while. My current interests are in Artificial Intelligence (especially [latent space navigation in deep generative models](https://wyhsirius.github.io/LIA-project/) and [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf)), [Neuroscience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8n1XODZ1Nc&ab_channel=MITCBMM), and [Rust](https://github.com/sarckk/rust-chip8).
