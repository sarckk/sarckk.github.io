I currently work on accelerating LLMs at Meta Superintelligence Labs. 

Previously, I worked on a PyTorch team scaling [distributed training of large recommendation models](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchrec). Before that, I worked on developer infrastructure for [Reality Labs](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/).

I'm based in San Francisco.
