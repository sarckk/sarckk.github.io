This is a list of things that I believe to be generally true at the time of me writing this, but I suspect some of these will need to be updated in the future with more nuance. I try to incorporate these learnings into my life, but as with most things, it&rsquo;s a process! That said, I found the practice of compiling the list of things I&rsquo;ve learned to be incredibly helpful in clarifying my own beliefs and putting my experience into perspective and recommend that others try it out too. With that, here&rsquo;s some things I&rsquo;ve learned recently:</p><ol><li>Keep learning things. If you&rsquo;re learning in your job, that&rsquo;s great. If you&rsquo;re not, do everything you can do learn outside of work.</li><li>Always be in the process of <em>becoming</em> something, not because of expected future reward, but because you&rsquo;ll fall into a meaning crisis otherwise.</li><li>Sometimes you need to fall into mud to really know how to get out of it, so don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for having fallen into one.</li><li>Winners today might be losers tomorrow, and vice-versa. Be aware of the transcience of things.</li><li>Prepare for the worst while things are good.</li><li>Work with the constraints you have. Build a narrative around your constraints and turn them into a competitive advantage.</li><li>The antidote to emptiness is to fill your life with experiences until there&rsquo;s no more space left. Spend every day exploring things you&rsquo;re interested in, or even somewhat vaguely interested in, to the full. Really dig deep into learning <strong>how</strong> things work and <strong>why</strong> things work that way. Keep digging until you convince yourself that there&rsquo;s not much more to be done.</li><li>Your intentions very much dictate what you see. Often you&rsquo;ll notice opportunties in your situation once the intention is there.</li><li>Be wary about any worldview that paints a binary picture of the world. Few things are completely black or white; most truths lie somewhere in the nuanced shades of gray.</li><li>If you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re interested in, a good place to start is to try to improve the little things that are bothering you.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t surround yourself with people that bore you.</li><li>Doing something, even if it doesn&rsquo;t immediately appeal to you, is better than doing nothing. If at the end of it you realize you don&rsquo;t like doing it, that&rsquo;s a valuable lesson learned.</li><li>The only real way to figure out what you like is by trying out a lot of things. Expect some suffering.</li><li>Cut out the noise and look at your current situation with clear judgement. In which areas are you doing well and in which are you not?</li><li>When you&rsquo;re young, say <em>yes</em> more often than <em>no</em> if you&rsquo;re unsure. Some of the best opportunities and people I&rsquo;ve met have come from saying <em>yes</em>.</li><li>Exercise.</li><li>Sometimes you need to eat the shit sandwich.</li><li>Try to live every day with a sense of awe. Take long walks and try to notice the little things.</li><li>Prioritize ruthlessly.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t beat yourself too much for failing to do any of the above. <a href=https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/excuse-me-but-why-are-you-eating target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop eating so many frogs</a>
.</li><li><a href=https://norvig.com/21-days.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Take a long-term view of things</a></li><li>Don&rsquo;t take things too seriously. Most things aren&rsquo;t that important, and only a few things are.</li></ol></main><footer><script type=text/x-mathjax-config>
