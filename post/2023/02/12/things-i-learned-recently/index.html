A lot has changed in my life, and I thought I&rsquo;d write about the things I&rsquo;ve learned about myself, career, and life in the past half a year.</p><p>Some of these are amalgamations of things I&rsquo;ve read about in the past but have only recently begun to fully appreciate. It&rsquo;s also a list of things that I believe to be generally true at the time of me writing this, but I suspect some of these will not apply to all situations or people (see learning #8) or will need to be updated with more nuance in the future.</p><p>I nevertheless think these are generally good statements to live by. I myself try to incorporate these learnings into my life, but as with most things, it&rsquo;s a process!</p><p>I also found the practice of writing up the list of things I&rsquo;ve learned to be incredibly helpful in clarifying my own beliefs and putting my experience into perspective and recommend that others try it out too.</p><ol><li>The process of <em>becoming</em> something gives your life a whole lot of meaning. Much of life is becoming a better version of yourself.</li><li>Everything is transcient.</li><li>The best people learn to work with the constraints they have and turn them into an advantage.</li><li>Sometimes you really do need to eat a shit sandwich. Resigning yourself to this makes eating it easier.</li><li>One antidote to emptiness/meaninglessness &ndash; other than spirituality &ndash; that I suspect would work for a lot of people is to explore something to the fullest until you get to the bottom of <em>how</em> it works and <em>why</em> it works that way.</li><li>If you don&rsquo;t know what you want to do right now, try to do small things that bring incremental improvements to your life.</li><li>Your intention determines what you see.</li><li>Few things are completely black or white; most truths lie somewhere in the nuanced shades of gray. You should generally be wary of any worldview that presents a binary picture of the world.</li><li>Doing something, even if it doesn&rsquo;t immediately appeal to you, is better than doing nothing. If at the end of it you realize you don&rsquo;t like doing it, that&rsquo;s a valuable lesson learned.</li><li>It&rsquo;s important to <a href=https://norvig.com/21-days.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">take a long-term view of things</a>
. Life is pretty long.</li><li>Life is also pretty short. Prioritize ruthlessly.</li><li>The only reliable way to figure out what you like is by trying out a lot of things.</li><li>If life feels like <a href=https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/excuse-me-but-why-are-you-eating target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">eating one frog after another</a>
, you&rsquo;re probably doing something wrong.</li><li>Saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; can be important, but when you&rsquo;re young, it&rsquo;s often a good strategy to lean towards a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; <em>if you&rsquo;re unsure</em>. This is because most people are in the <a href=https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">divergent</a>
phases of their lives when they&rsquo;re young.</li><li>The kind of life you lead currently, in whatever capacity, is only a small droplet in a sea of possibilities of how one can live one&rsquo;s life.</li><li>Dreams don&rsquo;t need to be constrained to a noun. I used to tell people that my dream is to be a tech founder but right now it&rsquo;s more like: &ldquo;do cool stuff at the cutting edge of knowledge&rdquo;. This is still vague and I&rsquo;m trying to refine it further as I go, but this opens up the possibility to achieve it in many different ways.</li><li>Exercise!</li><li>The amount of human ingenuity that went into the things around you &ndash; including the device you&rsquo;re reading this post on &ndash; is really quite staggering.</li><li>Sometimes you need to fall into mud to really know how to get out of it, so don&rsquo;t beat yourself up for having fallen into one.</li><li>Most things in life aren&rsquo;t <em>that</em> important. Only a few things are.</li></ol></main></div><div class=right-container></div></div><footer><script type=text/x-mathjax-config>
