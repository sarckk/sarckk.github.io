In the world of AI that means I&rsquo;m already late to the party, but with extra time this week I thought I&rsquo;d finally start playing around with it to see what it can do. People have already started leveraging the power of GPT-4 to create impressive projects, like <a href=https://twitter.com/ammaar target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">@ammaar</a>
who used GPT-4 and other AI tools like MidJourney to <a href=https://twitter.com/samuelwoods_/status/1642889718336479233 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">create a 3D game in Javascript from scratch</a>
and <a href=https://twitter.com/mortenjust target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">@mortenjust</a>
who <a href=https://twitter.com/mortenjust/status/1639276571574894594 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">made and published an iOS app</a>
by prompting GPT-4.</p><p>Since I spend a considerable time browsing and reading interesting &ndash; mostly tech related &ndash; articles on the internet, I&rsquo;ve long been interested in making my own knowledge management solution for the many pages I bookmark. So I thought this would be a perfect little project to play around with GPT-4 to see what it&rsquo;s capable of, and to catch a glimpse of what software engineering might look like not too far from now. For this experiment, I wanted to create a Chrome extension that would allow users to run semantic Q&amp;A on the contents of their bookmarks. I have built a Chrome extension <a href=https://github.com/moduda-live/moduda-extension target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">before</a>
, so I thought my familiarity with it would help me assess GPT&rsquo;s code.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have ChatGPT Plus &ndash; so I used Bing Chat instead, since it was <a href=https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">recently confirmed to be running on GPT-4</a>
anyway. In the beginning, I asked the model to show me the code for a simple Chrome extension that when the extension logo was clicked, would open a html page that lists all of user&rsquo;s bookmarks on Chrome. After a few nudges (for example, asking it to open the html page on a new tab instead of in a popup), it correctly output the code for the Javascript and HTML files as well as the <code>manifest.json</code> file, and within minutes I had a very simple extension working:</p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/first_demo.png alt></p><p>Unfortunately, my browser crashed and I lost the history of the chat for this part, but it&rsquo;s not particularly interesting (by GPT standards, anyway). That said, even as someone who came in with high expectations having already what GPT can do, the feeling of describing what you want to build at a high level and have the generated code work seamlessly is nothing short of a magical experience.</p><p>At this point I had a <code>main.js</code> file that fetches the user&rsquo;s bookmarks and displays them, but not much else. I wanted to add a feature whereby the user would click a button next to each bookmark item, which would first grab the content from the link, create an embedding via <a href=https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI Embedding API</a>
and index it in the <a href=https://www.pinecone.io/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Pinecone vector database</a>
.</p><p>I used <a href=https://github.com/sarckk/gpt_experiments/blob/53ccd300a92a309397f63790d3f2a708a7065ba4/prompt_test target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">this prompt</a>
to ask GPT to do just that:</p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/first_iter.jpeg alt>
<em>At first I asked the model to index the embedding for all bookmarks</em></p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/add_spinner.jpeg alt>
<em>Then I asked it to display a spinner when waiting for the API call and to show a red error message when it fails</em></p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/add_spinner_css.jpeg alt>
<em>It even generated the correct CSS for the spinning animation!</em></p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/add_button.jpeg alt>
<em>Then I thought it&rsquo;d probably be a better idea to have a button next to each bookmark item that users could press to create the embedding and index it in the DB</em></p><p>In the end, it came up with <a href=https://github.com/sarckk/gpt_experiments/tree/53ccd300a92a309397f63790d3f2a708a7065ba4 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>
. The API calls to OpenAI and Pinecone endpoints were not correct &ndash; both using a wrong endpoint (e.g. <code>https://api.pinecone.io/v1/vector-indexes/&lt;INDEX_NAME>/vectors</code>) and passing in invalid data in the body &ndash; but this was somewhat expected because training data for GPT-4 (which were <a href=https://openai.com/research/gpt-4 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">cut off at September 2021</a>
) presumably didn&rsquo;t contain data about these services.</p><h2 id=a-subtle-javascript-bug>A subtle Javascript bug</h2><p>Never mind the API issues, I loaded up the updated version of the extension locally to see if everything else was working correctly. Not quite &ndash;</p><p><video src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/buggy_mvp.mp4 controls></video></p><p>I noticed that clicking on any button was causing the spinning icon and the error message to only appear on the last item in the list. It turned out that there was a subtle Javascript bug in the <a href=https://github.com/sarckk/gpt_experiments/blob/53ccd300a92a309397f63790d3f2a708a7065ba4/main.js target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>main.js</code></a>
that the model generated. Can you spot it?</p><p>In the generated code, for each button we add an event listener for the click event, such that when it registers a click, we add a HTML <code>&lt;span></code> element (which serves as both the spinner and the error message) as a child of the <code>li</code> list element, and begin the <code>fetch()</code> calls:</p><pre><code>button.addEventListener('click', function () {
            spinner.classList.add('spinner');
            spinner.textContent = '';
            li.appendChild(spinner);

            fetch(bookmark.url)
                .then(response =&gt; response.text())
                .then(text =&gt; {
                // ...and more
</code></pre><p>But the issue is that the <code>li</code> variable is defined using the <code>var</code> keyword, a few lines earlier!:</p><pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; bookmarks.length; i++) {
        var bookmark = bookmarks[i];
        var li = document.createElement('li');
        // ...and more
</code></pre><p>For those who are not familiar with Javascript, <code>var</code> is one of three ways you can declare a variable in JS, along with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>. It is also the oldest &ndash; today, it isn&rsquo;t really used anymore and is mostly a remnant of a past time in the language&rsquo;s history. Importantly, variables declared with the <code>var</code> keyword have either <a href=https://javascript.info/var target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>global scope or function scope</strong></a>
, unlike <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> which have block scope. This means that variables declared with <code>var</code> are visible through blocks, like in <code>if</code> statements or in <code>for/while</code> loops. For example, this is valid JS code:</p><pre><code>if (true) {
  var fruit = &quot;Apple&quot;
}
console.log(fruit)

// output
Apple
</code></pre><p>while this is not:</p><pre><code>if (true) {
  let fruit = &quot;Apple&quot;
}
console.log(fruit)

// output
console.log(fruit)
            ^

ReferenceError: fruit is not defined

</code></pre><p>Going back to our original example, the variable <code>li</code> is declared with <code>var</code> in a <code>for</code> loop, and since it&rsquo;s <strong>not block-scoped</strong>, it&rsquo;s also <strong>not loop-local</strong> (i.e. all iterations of the loop refer to one same <code>li</code> variable). In fact, because it is defined in the callback function for <code>chrome.bookmarks.getTree()</code>, it is <strong>function-scoped</strong>. By the time the for loop completes and the event listener for the click event gets registered for all the buttons in our list, the <code>li</code> button refers to the HTML last <code>&lt;li></code>element.</p><p>When the user clicks on a button, it calls the callback function for that button. This callback function is a <a href=https://javascript.info/closure target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">closure</a>
that keeps a reference to the <code>li</code> variable that was declared outside of it (the <code>li</code> variable is in its <a href=https://javascript.info/closure#lexical-environment target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">outer Lexical Environment</a>
, to be exact), and as we have seen, there is only one function-scoped <code>li</code> variable that refers to the last bookmark.</p><p>Javascript can be confusing sometimes!</p><h2 id=back-to-bing>Back to Bing</h2><p>Now that we&rsquo;re done with that brief detour to Javascript technicalities, let&rsquo;s see if the AI could spot the mistake in its code:</p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/can_you_spot_error.png alt></p><p>Nope.</p><p>With a little help from me, it looked like it had figured it out on a second try. But looking closer, I realised it hadn&rsquo;t quite figured it out:</p><p><img src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/did_gpt_really_fix_it.png alt></p><p>Here it explains that the bug was that the event listener function for <code>button</code> is a closure over the block-scoped <code>spinner</code> and <code>error</code> variables. This is not true, because while the event listener function does indeed close over <code>spinner</code>, <code>error</code> is just a variable that we use to denote the error that was caught in Promises we get when we call <code>fetch()</code>:</p><pre><code>fetch('https://api.pinecone.io/v1/vector-indexes/&lt;INDEX_NAME&gt;/vectors', options)
  .then(response =&gt; response.json())
  .then(data =&gt; console.log(data))
  .catch(**error** =&gt; showError(spinner, error));
</code></pre><p>Even if we accept that the event listener function for <code>button</code> closes over <code>error</code> as well, the subsequent claim that it will &ldquo;use the last value of <code>spinner</code> and <code>error</code> that were defined in the loop&rdquo; is plainly false, because <code>spinner</code> is defined with the <code>const</code> keyword, meaning it is block-scoped, as I demonstrate in the following small example I put together:</p><iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/recursing-grass-7184cx?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark" style=width:100%;height:500px;border:0;border-radius:4px;overflow:hidden title=recursing-grass-7184cx allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe><p>As you can see, clicking the button for spinner X only changes the text content for spinner X, and leaves the other spinners untouched. This is because <code>spinner</code> is declared with <code>const</code> and is block-scoped. Try changing this to <code>var</code>, and we run into the same issue as we were seeing in our Chrome extension.</p><p>Funnily though, Bing Chat&rsquo;s proposed solution &ndash; to move the logic of adding an event listener to a separate function <code>createButtonEventListener</code> &ndash; <strong>actually ends up fixing the bug</strong>! This is because when we pass the variable <code>li</code> into the <code>createButtonEventListener</code> function, we are passing the <strong>reference</strong> to the HTML element <em>by value</em>, and since the original bug was caused by the value of <code>li</code> (i.e. the reference) being constantly overriden with every loop, we no longer face this problem. In other words, since the event listener function for <code>button</code> now gets its own (correct) reference to the <code>li</code> element, it works properly. I guess that works too, but as a human, I would&rsquo;ve simply declared the <code>li</code> variable using the <code>const</code> keyword instead.</p><p>The full changes can be found <a href=https://github.com/sarckk/gpt_experiments/commit/28d691901317dd08f19dabfb9b993f75d4110f66 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>
. This actually introduced another bug but after I asked GPT to fix it (which it did) things were working correctly! (well, I guess if you can ignore the fact that the API call itself is failing):</p><p><video src=https://sarckk.github.io/media/working_mvp.mp4 controls></video>
<em>Doesn&rsquo;t seem like much but hey, at least I didn&rsquo;t write a single line of code!</em></p><p>After this point, I only played around with the bot a few more times before I stopped. If you are interested, you can find the code &ndash; along with a brief history of changes &ndash; on <a href=https://github.com/sarckk/gpt_experiments target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">github</a>
.</p><h2 id=programming-with-bing-chat-yay-or-nay>Programming with Bing Chat: yay or nay?</h2><p>Overall, I think Bing Chat/GPT-4 is a great companion for programming, but as it stands, it has a few shortcomings that necessitates the presence of a human in the loop. As I&rsquo;ve demonstrated in this article, it can create an impression that it is reasoning about things correctly even when it gets it wrong. It might even suggest a solution that works by chance, fooling the human if one does not pay close attention. The examples here and documented extensively elsewhere serve as cautionary tales for anyone looking to rely on LLMs to generate production-grade code: while technically impressive, these models are not perfect &ndash; well, just like humans. I am also aware that I technically used Bing Chat here, which runs a version of GPT-4 particularly optimized for search (and presumably not for code generation), so these observations may not hold for GPT-4, but a recent post by <a href=https://twitter.com/bradgessler target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">@bradgessler</a>
on <a href=https://fly.io/ruby-dispatch/pairing-with-gpt-4/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">pairing with GPT-4</a>
seems to have reached a similar conclusion. It&rsquo;s also possible that GPT-4&rsquo;s 32k context window would solve all if not most of the problems highlighted in this article, by simply allowing you to include a significant portion of the codebase before each question.</p><p>That said, I am optimistic about the future of software engineering in an age where powerful LLMs are commoditized and accessible. Steve Jobs famously said that computers are like a &ldquo;bicycle for our minds&rdquo;. With the rapid advancement of LLMs, it will be like adding a jet engine to the bicycle &ndash; these models will serve as powerful tools for us to translate human ideas and ingenuity into languages that computers can understand.</p></main><footer><script type=text/x-mathjax-config>
