While it was originally proposed and used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like language translation, it turns out that a lot of things that we care about can be modelled in terms of sequences, making transformers a useful model in a wide variety of applications beyond NLP such as image processing and reinforcement learning .</description></item><item><title>Convolutional Neural Networks from Scratch</title><link>https://sarckk.github.io/post/2022/03/20/convolutional-neural-networks-from-scratch/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarckk.github.io/post/2022/03/20/convolutional-neural-networks-from-scratch/</guid><description>In this blog post we are going to take a look at how to implement a simple CNN model from scratch in Python, using mostly just numpy.
In practice, we can use high-level libraries such as Keras or PyTorch to abstract away the underlying details of CNN when writing code. However, we find that the exercise of writing one from scratch is very helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of CNNs and how these frameworks work under the hood.</description></item></channel></rss>
